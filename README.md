## Configuring Your AI Agents: From Setup to Success

Configuration is where the magic happens. You'll define your AI personalities, set up audio parameters, and fine-tune the conversation experience. The process is intuitive, but the possibilities are endless.

### 1. Setting Up Your Configuration Foundation

```bash
# Copy example configuration
sudo cp elevenlabs.conf.example /etc/asterisk/elevenlabs.conf
sudo chown asterisk:asterisk /etc/asterisk/elevenlabs.conf
sudo chmod 640 /etc/asterisk/elevenlabs.conf
```

### 2. Crafting Your Voice Agent Personalities

This is where your vision comes to life. Each voice agent configuration represents a distinct AI personality that can handle different types of voice interactions. Think of it as assembling your intelligent voice AI team.

Edit `/etc/asterisk/elevenlabs.conf`:

```ini
[general]
# Global settings for your Asterisk ElevenLabs integration
debug=false

[sales_agent]
# Your charismatic sales voice agent that knows when to listen and when to pitch
elevenlabs_api_key=sk-your-api-key-here
elevenlabs_get_signed_url_endpoint=https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url
elevenlabs_agent_id=agent_0301k2f1kzshe85t9w74t66vz1km
elevenlabs_send_caller_number=true  # Share caller ID for personalized greetings
elevenlabs_audio_frames_buffer_ms=240  # Optimized for responsive sales conversations
debug=false
max_connection_attempts=3
connection_timeout_seconds=10

[support_agent]
# Your patient, helpful support voice agent that excels at problem-solving
elevenlabs_api_key=sk-your-api-key-here
elevenlabs_get_signed_url_endpoint=https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/convai/conversation/get-signed-url
elevenlabs_agent_id=agent_another_agent_id_here
elevenlabs_send_caller_number=false  # Privacy-focused support interactions
elevenlabs_audio_frames_buffer_ms=300  # Slightly longer buffer for detailed explanations
debug=true  # Enable detailed logging for support quality monitoring
max_connection_attempts=5  # Extra resilience for critical support calls
```

**Configuration Philosophy**: Each parameter shapes the conversation experience. Shorter audio buffers create snappier interactions perfect for sales, while longer buffers provide stability for complex support scenarios.

### 3. Integrating Voice AI into Your Asterisk Dialplan

The dialplan integration is beautifully simple, yet incredibly powerful. With just one line, you can transform any extension into a voice AI-powered conversation endpoint. The module's framehook architecture handles all the complex audio routing automatically.

Add to your dialplan (`/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf`):

```ini
[default]
; Elegant simplicity - your voice AI sales agent handles everything
exten => 100,1,Answer()
exten => 100,2,ElevenLabsConversationalAI(sales_agent)
; The conversation flows naturally and ends when appropriate - no manual intervention needed

; Support line with optional timeout for testing
exten => 200,1,Answer()
exten => 200,2,ElevenLabsConversationalAI(support_agent)
exten => 200,3,Wait(3600)  ; Safety net: maximum 1-hour conversation limit
exten => 200,4,Hangup()

; Advanced routing example - different voice agents based on caller ID
exten => 300,1,Answer()
exten => 300,2,GotoIf($["${CALLERID(num)}" = "VIP_CUSTOMER"]?vip:standard)
exten => 300,3(standard),ElevenLabsConversationalAI(sales_agent)
exten => 300,4,Hangup()
exten => 300,5(vip),ElevenLabsConversationalAI(vip_support_agent)
exten => 300,6,Hangup()
```

**The Beauty of Framehook Integration**: Unlike traditional IVR systems that require complex audio routing, this module uses Asterisk's native framehook system to seamlessly fork audio in both directions. This means crystal-clear voice agent conversations with minimal latency.

### 4. Load and Test

```bash
# Reload configuration
sudo asterisk -rx "module reload app_elevenlabs_convai"

# Reload dialplan
sudo asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"

# Enable debug for testing
sudo asterisk -rx "elevenlabs debug on"

# Test the setup
# Make a call to extension 100 or 200
```

## Understanding the Technical Architecture

### The Journey of a Voice AI-Powered Call

Ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when someone calls your voice AI-enabled number? The process is a sophisticated orchestration of Asterisk components, WebSocket protocols, and real-time voice processing. Let's walk through this fascinating journey of how voice agents come to life.

1. **The Spark**: When someone dials your extension, Asterisk executes `ElevenLabsConversationalAI(agent_name)` and the voice agent magic begins
2. **Voice Agent Loading**: Your carefully crafted voice agent configuration springs into action, defining personality and conversational behavior
3. **Secure Handshake**: A secure HTTP request to ElevenLabs fetches a signed WebSocket URL – your golden ticket to voice AI conversations
4. **Connection Establishment**: A rock-solid WebSocket connection forms the secure bridge between your Asterisk system and ElevenLabs' voice AI infrastructure
5. **Voice Processing Activation**: Here's where the framehook brilliance shines – bidirectional voice processing begins seamlessly:
   - Every word from your caller gets captured, buffered intelligently, and transmitted as pristine base64 audio chunks to the voice agent
   - Voice AI responses flow back through optimized queues and get injected into the call with microsecond precision (20ms frame timing)
6. **Intelligent Voice Agent Management**: 
   - Voice Activity Detection continuously monitors conversation dynamics between caller and voice agent
   - Interruption events trigger sophisticated audio queue filtering – when someone interrupts the voice agent, the system responds instantly
   - Event-based voice processing ensures natural conversation flow between human and voice AI
7. **Background Orchestration**: Multiple threads work in harmony – framehooks capture voice data, WebSocket threads manage voice agent communication, and playback threads deliver voice AI responses
8. **Graceful Conclusions**: Conversations end naturally when the voice agent determines completion, triggering automatic call termination
9. **Perfect Cleanup**: Every resource, buffer, and connection gets cleaned up automatically – no memory leaks, no lingering voice processing threads
